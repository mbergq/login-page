# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project was made to practice creating a login / register page. The focus was
to make it work with a webtoken and to connect the frontend with the backend.

I've learned a bit about typescript as well, this is my first project where I've
used it.

There is still a lot to do in terms of UI/UX but that's something i might come
back and finish later. The goal was to practice developing functionality in react
and ts so styling and such is secondary.
